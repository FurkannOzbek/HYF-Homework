INGREDIENTS

* 3 Tbsp olive oil, I use a mild extra virgin
* 500 g lamb, lean cut, cut into 2 cm dice
* 1 medium onion, roughly chopped
* 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 50 g tomato paste
* 2 tsp pul biber (Aleppo pepper)
* 1 tsp sugar
* 400 g tomato, skinned and chopped (I use fresh, but canned will do)
* water
* a little chopped parsley, to garnish (optional)
* salt and pepper

BEĞENDI SAUCE

* 1 kg aubergine (eggplant)
* 25 g butter
* 25 g white flour
* 250 ml whole milk
* salt and pepper

HOW I MAKE IT

1. Grill the aubergines directly on a gas flame, turning regularly, until completely burnt and soft. This usually takes around 10–15 minutes. Cool slightly then peel off the burnt skin. Alternatively, you can roast the aubergines in a very hot oven (250 °C) until completely soft (around 1 hour), but you'll lose most of the smoky flavour that makes the sauce unique.
2. Meanwhile, heat a thick bottomed wide pot over medium/high heat. Season the lamb pieces with salt and pepper, then brown in batches in the olive oil, using as much oil as needed. Set aside.
3. Turn the heat down to medium, then fry the onion, stirring regularly, until soft and translucent, but not browned, 8–10 minutes or more.
4. Add the garlic, tomato paste, pul biber and sugar. Fry for another 1–2 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid burning.
5. Return the lamb pieces (along with their juices) to the pan alongside the chopped tomatoes and enough water to just cover the meat. Season with salt and pepper, then bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and leave to simmer until the meat is completely tender, 45 minutes to an hour or more, depending on the cut. Leave off the heat for 10–15 minutes before serving.
6. Meanwhile, place a a large, thick bottomed frying pan or pot over medium heat. Add the butter and, once melted, the flour. Whisk until completely mixed, then add the milk while whisking vigorously. Keep stirring until you have a thick sauce, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Take off the heat. Roughly chop the smoky aubergine and add to the sauce. Taste for seasoning once more.
7. Add the begendi sauce to serving plates, topping with the lamb stew and a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley, then serve immediately.
